A role-based to-do app built with Python Django and MySQL allows users to manage tasks with specific roles and permissions. Users can log in, and based on their roles (Admin, Manager, User), they can create, update, delete, or view tasks. The app ensures secure task management with Django's authentication system and stores data in a MySQL database
